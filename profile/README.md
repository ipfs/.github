The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring [content-addressed data](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#content-addressing) in a decentralized file system. Many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS - see the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech/) for a list of some of these projects.

Exceptionally talented open communities are building the future of the decentralized web. Excellent [good first issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aipfs+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22%2C%22help+wanted%22&type=issues) need your attention and support! [Join the movement!
