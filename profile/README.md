The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring [content-addressed data](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#content-addressing) in a decentralized file system. Many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS - see the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech/) for a list of some of these projects.

Exceptionally talented open communities are building the future of the decentralized web. There are excellent "good first issues" that need your attention and support! Join the movement, get involved today!
