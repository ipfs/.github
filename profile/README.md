# Building blocks for a better web

IPFS is a modular suite of protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring data, designed from the ground up with the principles of content addressing and peer-to-peer networking. We believe in open and resilient networks that belong to the users. These are the building blocks to make that possible.

You can find a wide array of real-world projects built with IPFS in the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech/) and [awesome-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs) list.
