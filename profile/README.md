# IPFS is an open system to manage data without a central server

IPFS is a modular suite of protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring data, designed from the ground up with the principles of content addressing and peer-to-peer networking. Many projects are built on IPFS - see the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech/) for some of these projects.
